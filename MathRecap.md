## Introduction

### Notation

∈ - means is an element of. for example 3 ∈{1,2,3,4,5}.

⊃ - A ⊇ B means every element of B is also an element of A. A ⊃ B means A ⊇ B but A ≠ B.

⊂ - (subset) A ⊆ B means every element of A is also an element of B.(proper subset) A ⊂ B means A ⊆ B but A ≠ B.

### Factorials

Definition

The definition of the factorial is that for any positive whole number n, the factorial:

n! = n x (n -1) x (n - 2) x . . . x 2 x 1

Examples for Small Values

    1! = 1
    2! = 2 x 1 = 2
    3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6
    4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
    5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
    6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720
    7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040
    8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40320
    9! = 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 362880
    10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800
