# Seaching

Searching is one of the most common operations in computing. In fact, solving most problems computationally can be seen as a form of search â€“ looking for an answer amid a multitude of possibilities.

For instance finding the median in a list is a typical searching problem

    What are the medians of [5, 7, 1, 6, 8, 22, 11, 34, 16, 4, 12] and of [6, 9, 2, 8, 17, 5, 31, 19, 3, 4, 15, 37]?

    Sorting the lists we get:

    [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 34] and

    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17, 19, 31, 37].

    therfore the median of the first list is 8 and the second list is 8.5 ((8+9)/2).
