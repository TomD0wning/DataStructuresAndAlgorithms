    # Representation
    # --------------
    # We use the adjacency list representation, but with sets instead of lists.
    # The graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and
    # the corresponding value is the set of the node's neighbours.
    # The graph being undirected, each edge is represented twice.
    # For example, the dictionary {1: {2, 3}, 2: {1}, 3: {1}} represents a
    # graph with three nodes and two edges connecting node 1 with the other two.
